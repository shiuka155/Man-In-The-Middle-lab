# Lab summary: Man in the middle detection

In this lab, I analysed network behavior to identify signs of a MITM attack. 
MITM attacks allow an attacker to intercept, modify, or redirect network traffic without the victim's knowledge

The analysis focused on abnormal ARP behavior, suspicious DNS responses, and unexpected traffic patterns that indicate traffic interception

From a SOC analyst perspective, these behaviors are critical early warning signs of a compromised network
