# Man-In-The-Middle-lab
Detect man in the middle (MITM) attack by using Wireshark

# Overview
This lab focuses on detecting MITM attacks by analysing network behavior, ARP activity, DNS anomalies, and suspicious traffic patterns. The goal is to identify indicators that suggest traffic interception or manipulation by an attacker

# Objectives
- Understand how MITM attacks work at the network level
- Identify suspicious ARP behavior
- Detect DNS and traffic manipulation
- Analyze indicators or MITM activity using network analysis techniques

# Skills earned
- Network traffic analysis
- ARP spoofing detection
- DNS anomaly identification
- Security monitoring mindset (SOC)
